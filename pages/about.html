                    This site is a personal project I created as part of my web development class, but it’s also something I’ve wanted for myself for a long time-a simple way to keep track of the media I enjoy. 
                    Whether it’s anime series I’m watching, games I’m playing, or movies I’ve been meaning to see, it all ends up here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built this site to help me stay organized and intentional about how I spend my time with entertainment. 
                    Each entry lets me log release dates, note whether I’ve finished something, am currently watching or playing it, or plan to check it out in the future. 
                    I’ve also added a rating system so I can look back and remember how I felt about each title—everything gets a score between 1.0 and 10.0, based purely on my experience. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This site isn’t just a tracker—it’s a reflection of my interests and how they evolve over time. Thanks for stopping by and taking a look at what’s been on my screen lately!
