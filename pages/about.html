                <p>Hi there, and welcome to my media log!</p>
                <p>
                    This site is a personal project I created as part of my web development class, but it's also something I've wanted for myself for a long time-a simple way to keep track of the media I enjoy. 
                    Whether it's anime series I'm watching, games I'm playing, or movies I've been meaning to see, it all ends up here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I built this site to help me organize the different forms of entertainment that I consume. 
                    Each entry lets me log release dates, note whether I've finished something, am currently watching or playing it, or plan to check it out in the future. 
                    I will also be able to give a rating so I can look back and remember how I felt about each title—everything gets a score between 1.0 and 10.0, based purely on my experience. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This site isn't just a tracker—it's a reflection of my interests and how they evolve over time. Thanks for stopping by and taking a look at what's been on my screen lately!
                </p>
